# Linear Regression Model

This repository provides a basic implementation of a **Linear Regression** model using Python and scikit-learn. It demonstrates how to train a model on a simple dataset, make predictions, and visualize the results.

## 📌 Features

- Loads sample data using NumPy.
- Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Trains a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
- Predicts values and evaluates model performance.
- Plots the regression line with matplotlib.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:



git clone https://github.com/Hema-lab-hae/Linear-Regression1.git
cd Linear-Regression1

2. Run the script:



python main.py

You should see:

The coefficients and intercept of the model.

Mean Squared Error (MSE).

R² score of the model.

A plot showing the data points and the regression line.

📈 Output Example

Coefficients: [m]

Intercept: b

Mean Squared Error: E

R² Score: R


A matplotlib window will display showing the regression line fit to the data points.
